# CodeWars Challenges
## Challenge summary
In order to remain nimble in solving alogrithmic problems I have test-driven solutions to some Codewars katas.
Some are JavaScript. I have trained to the highest level in Ruby. Some are in C#, or Python.
## Steps
1. Test Driven and solved in VSCode. 
2. Extracted back to codewars to check they pass more examples. 
3. Run through a linter, checked for test coverage and comitted.
